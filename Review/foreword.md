# Foreword:

## Why math?
Initially I planned to jump straight into describing condensed matter. But then I thought, "maybe it would help if I can jog down the physics that give rise to condensed matter!" and realized that maybe I should start with stat mech and quantum. But then I also realized both subjects utilize an abusive amount of linear algebra, which builds on top of the differential equation. Undeniably, the current most effective way, but not limited to the only way, known to mankind when it comes to describing physics is through mathematics. (•••) Just give an introduction to the math you're going to describe, don't start your intro until you're done with the details of each section. 

I plan on addressing the mathematics that are commonly used in E&M, QM, stat mech and classical mechanics (both phase and configuration spaces).
