## What is this for?
This is a documentation by a recent physics graduate who is unwilling to let go of something that occupy all of him for the past 3 years. I found out that I learned so much more and remember things much better when I was reading on my own out of my own curiosity, so, sometimes it really helps to be motivated by genuine interest when it comes to learning. I'm also very interested in reintroducing materials for my own benefits as well as for those who would like to revisit them. I would like to use this opportunity to untangle some of the knots in processing the information. 

## Goal:
Struggle is necessary in learning just about anything, and for physics, it is without a doubt you have to question everything thoroughly instead of merely picking up new information. I believe that getting to thoroughly question what you have read, and deriving the necessary equations help de-clutter your own confusion, which helps to bridge the smaller puzzles to bigger concepts. I would also like to use this opportunity to bridge the different topics of physics together in Materials Science research. I also hope that I could maximize my understanding of the subject to a much more prolific level. 

In my personal experience, summarizing a book and dropping them down as notes, as you may have already done so, gives you a totally different level of understanding. While some theorists may disagree due to the inefficiency of writing, I believe that the "niche" detail is often key to a much more prolific understanding. However, one can undeniably say this can lead you to a rabbit hole. Those who have written a senior thesis would know that their mental blocks are areas that they can use some more work to study and learn, which is to say, sometimes, mental block can expose your weaknesses, and with enough time, one can deepen their understanding; other times, you work with what you know given the limited time. 

The ultimate objective of this website, really, is to give myself an opportunity to revisit concepts that I wish I had more time to learn more about by removing the due date barrier, in hopes that I can grasp the more complicated ideas that build on top of one another more easily, and also to fall in love with physics all over again.
