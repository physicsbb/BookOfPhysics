## What is this for?
This is a documentation by a physics graduate who is unwilling to let go of something that occupy all of him for 3 whole years. Despite the importance of finishing tasks on time, which I can do, I often find the quality of my work under the stress of deadline to be sometimes lacking, and often left out some gaps in my understanding. I also learned so much better when I was reading out of my own curiosity, so, naturally it helps to revisit the materials and take my time to digest every step of the derivation and question every gap that I encounter, and writing a summary is a great exercise to expose your lack of understanding in a subject. I'm also very interested in reintroducing materials for my own benefits as well as for those who would like to revisit them. I would like to use this opportunity to untangle some of the knots in processing the information. Hopefully one day this would come in handy when I become a teaching assistant if I ever pursue my graduate studies.

## Goal:
Struggle is necessary in learning just about anything, and this is especially true for physics. I would like to use this opportunity to expose my lack of understanding in certain subjects, and identify my interests in specific topics and categorize which subjects are worth pursuing and which ones are not, bridge the different topics of physics together in Materials Science/Applied Physics research, all for the purpose of deepening my understanding of fundamental science. 

In my personal experience, summarizing a book and dropping them down as note gives you a totally different level of understanding. While some theorists may disagree due to the inefficiency of writing, I believe that the "niche" detail is often key to a much more prolific understanding, and experimentalists cannot let it go. [*What theorists say is a little trick (in general relativity) may be an extremely difficult experiment*](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/ligo-gw-interferometer). However, one can undeniably say this can lead you to a rabbit hole. Those who have written a senior thesis would know that their mental blocks are areas that they can use some more work to study and learn, which is to say, sometimes, mental block can expose your weaknesses, and with enough time, one can deepen their understanding; other times, funfortunately, you work with what you know given the limited time. 

The ultimate objective of this website, really, is to give myself an opportunity to revisit concepts that I wish I had more time to learn about by removing the due date barrier, in hopes that I can grasp the more complicated ideas that build on top of one another more easily, indulge in the fun of understanding and also to fall in love with physics all over again.
