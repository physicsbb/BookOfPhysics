# Foreword

## Why math?
Initially I planned to jump straight into describing condensed matter. But then I thought, "maybe it would help if I can jog down the physics that give rise to condensed matter!" and realized that maybe I should start with stat mech and quantum. But then I also realized both subjects utilize an abusive amount of linear algebra, which builds on top of the differential equation. Undeniably, the current most effective way, but not limited to the only way, known to mankind when it comes to describing physics is through mathematics. (•••) Just give an introduction to the math you're going to describe, don't start your intro until you're done with the details of each section. 

I plan on addressing the mathematics that are commonly used in E&M, QM, stat mech and classical mechanics (both phase and configuration spaces). 

Keep in mind also, what you are reading is materials you may already have seen, and you may even find the majority of this work to be trivial. My writing for this is geared towards introducing physics in the most "parameterized" way possible, such that learners can more easily grasp at the ideas through the mathematical formalism. One can say that this is not really learning physics and is an elementary method; I say that having the capability to understand things by neatly parameterizing variables is the first step to an organized method of mastery. 

As an applied experimentalist at heart, one can say the project Book Of Physics is not of practical use because this is only addressing the mathematics, not the physics! I believe that once a learner has a solid grasp at the mathematical structure behind the physical model, understanding and mastery of the model would come more naturally. Despite the fact that this is merely review, and has no novelty or new fundamental discovery, I can certainly say that having a deeper understanding and being able to deliver the message in a more accessible format is still a good practice. It certainly can be great foundation for discovery that lies ahead!
