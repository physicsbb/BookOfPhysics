# Short Portfolio

## My background:
I am a recent [Physics](https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/education) graduate from [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu/). If I were to come up with a name for the focus of courses that I have taken, I would say Condensed Matter and Optics Applications. In my opinion, my two quarters of Condensed Matter, one quarter of Optics and one quarter of quantum photonics experiment shaped my perspective as a physics student driven by physical applications.

## Research:
I have one year of research experience in UV photonics in the [Materials Department](https://ssleec.ucsb.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Shuji Nakamura](https://materials.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/shuji-nakamura).

I have also previously conducted research at [San Francisco State University](https://engineering.sfsu.edu/) for a mitigation lab to help develop a program for [Dr. Zhaoshuo Jiang](https://engineering.sfsu.edu/faculty-profile-zhaoshuo-jiang) in 2019.


## Coursework:
Condensed Matter (Phys 123A/B), Optics (Phys 141), Quantum Photonics Experiment (ECE194/594U), All of Classical Mechanics, All of QM, All of E&M, thermo, MATLAB, PYTHON and some bash (Phys 129L), Analog/Digital Electronics for Physicists (Phys127A/BL), Materials Science Seminars in III-Nitride devices (MATRL 290)

## Outside of school:
I have previously been a lifeguard and swim instructor both at [SF Rec&Park](https://sfrecpark.org/482/Swimming-Pools) and [UCSF RecCen](https://campuslifeserviceshome.ucsf.edu/fitnessrecreation/aquatics), as well as a peer instructor for instructional aid at [Skyline College](https://www.skylinecollege.edu/stemcenter/index.php). At the moment I am a gymnastics coach at [Santa Barbara Gymnastics (Gym) Club](https://www.santabarbaragymnasticsclub.com/) teaching summer/winter camps and tumbling/gymnastics/parkour classes. Other times I am just enjoying the settings and sceneries of Santa Barbara and hanging out with friends.
