# Portfolio

## My background:
I am a recent Physics graduate from one of the UCs in California. If I were to come up with a name for the focus of courses that I have taken, I would say Condensed Matter and Optics Applications. In my opinion, my two quarters of Condensed Matter, one quarter of Optics and one quarter of quantum photonic experiment shaped my perspective as a physics student driven by physical applications.

## Research:
I have one year of research experience in UV photonics in the Materials Department under the supervision of Dr. Shuji Nakamura. I have also previously conducted research at San Francisco State University for a mitigation lab to help develop a program for Dr. Zhaoshuo Jiang in 2019.

## Coursework:
Condensed Matter, Optics, Quantum Photonic Experiment, All of Classical Mechanics, All of QM, All of E&M, thermo, MATLAB, PYTHON, some bash and some FPGA.
