## UV Photonics Research
UV photonic devices utilize AlGaN crystal (both a ZincBlende and Wurtzite) to achieve the generation of photons at the wavelength of 200nm to 350nm. Different regions of UV spectrum may have different growth technique, and each region in the spectrum has its challenges. See figure [AlGaNWavelength] for reference.

Al content in AlxGa(1-x)N, which results in the change in bandgap, hence a change in its wavelength.
