## Latest Career Update: 
I have begun working at GaNify, LLC since mid February 2024. My current role at GaNify is to assist the company in solidifying a process that can be standardized for the manufacturing of a HEMT based High Voltage Super-heterojunction FET device with high voltage switching applications. Our projects are currently [ARPA-E](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/news-and-media/press-releases/us-department-energy-announces-42-million-strengthen-reliability) funded. 

I would like to take a moment and express my gratitude for Dr. Shuji Nakamura's kind offering to me for an undergraduate internship, giving me the necessary experience as someone with a physics background to learn about GaN-based semiconductor technology, which ultimately led to me landing this career opportunity that is as close to a PhD as one can get. 


## My background:
I am a recent [Physics](https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/) graduate from [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu/). If I were to come up with a name for the focus of courses that I have taken, I would say Condensed Matter and Optics Applications. In my opinion, my two quarters of Condensed Matter, one quarter of Optics and one quarter of Quantum Photonics Experiment gave me a really unique perspective to pursue physical applications, with a motivation aimed towards translating scientific investigation into commercialization. I have seen this translation in the field of photonics in two separate applications, the currently-pretty-Novel Quantum Photonics Integrated Circuits (QPIC), and a Novel-30-Years-Ago Optoelectronics. 

## Research:
I have one year of research experience in UV photonics in the [Materials Department](https://ssleec.ucsb.edu/) under the supervision of [2014 Physics Nobel Prize Winner Dr. Shuji Nakamura](https://materials.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/shuji-nakamura).

I have also previously conducted research at [San Francisco State University](https://engineering.sfsu.edu/) for a mitigation lab to help develop a MATLAB program for [Dr. Zhaoshuo Jiang](https://engineering.sfsu.edu/faculty-profile-zhaoshuo-jiang) in 2019.

## Publication:
Please check out the three available publications that I have as a co-author here.

* *High external quantum efficiency (6.8%) UV-A LEDs on AlN templates with quantum barrier optimization*
    * **Authors**: Yifan Yao, Hongjian Li, Michael Wang, Panpan Li, ***Michael Lam***, Michael Iza, James Speck, Steve DenBaars, and Shuji Nakamura
    * **DOI**: [10.1364/OE.491622](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.491622)
    * The experimental HRXRD data in <105> plane generated on this paper was done by me. This also includes finding the experimental value of Al content found in this growth recipe.

    * **DOI**: [10.1063/5.0165328](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0165328)

* *Demonstration of III-Nitride Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSEL) with a topside dielectric curved mirror*
    * **Authors**: Nathan Palmquist, Jared Kearns, Stephen Gee, Arturo Juan, Srinivas Gandrothula, ***Michael Lam***, Steven P. Denbaars, Shuji Nakamura
    * **DOI**: [10.35848/1882-0786/ad119b](https://doi.org/10.35848/1882-0786/ad119b)
    * I have experimentally reported the RMS roughness on the DBR surface and was first to notice additional details on the DBR. They were done through the use of Atomic Force Microscope.

## Outside of school:
I have previously been a lifeguard and swim instructor both at [SF Rec&Park](https://sfrecpark.org/482/Swimming-Pools) and [UCSF Aquatics](https://campuslifeserviceshome.ucsf.edu/fitnessrecreation/aquatics), as well as a peer instructor for instructional aid at [Skyline College](https://www.skylinecollege.edu/stemcenter/index.php). 

At the moment, I am a gymnastics coach at [Santa Barbara Gymnastics (Gym) Club](https://www.santabarbaragymnasticsclub.com/) teaching summer/winter camps and tumbling/gymnastics/parkour classes. 

Other times I am just enjoying being in Santa Barbara, playing music and taking private lessons, writing this website, attempting here and there to improve the open source of JupyterBook Framework (in an amateur-ish fashion) and implementing MyST Markdown features onto the JupyterBook framework.
