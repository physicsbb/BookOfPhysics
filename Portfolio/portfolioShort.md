# Short Portfolio

## My background:
I am a recent Physics graduate from UCSB. If I were to come up with a name for the focus of courses that I have taken, I would say Condensed Matter and Optics Applications. In my opinion, my two quarters of Condensed Matter, one quarter of Optics and one quarter of quantum photonics experiment shaped my perspective as a physics student driven by physical applications.

## Research:
I have one year of research experience in UV photonics in the Materials Department under the supervision of Dr. Shuji Nakamura.

I have also previously conducted research at San Francisco State University for a mitigation lab to help develop a program for Dr. Zhaoshuo Jiang in 2019.


## Coursework:
Condensed Matter (Phys 123A/B), Optics (Phys 141), Quantum Photonics Experiment (ECE194/594U), All of Classical Mechanics, All of QM, All of E&M, thermo, MATLAB, PYTHON and some bash (Phys 129L), Analog/Digital Electronics for Physicists (Phys127A/BL)

## Outside of school:
I have previously been a lifeguard and swim instructor. At the moment I am a gymnastics coach at Santa Barbara Gymnastics (Gym) Club teaching summer/winter camps, .
