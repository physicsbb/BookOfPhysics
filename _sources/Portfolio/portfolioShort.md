# Short Portfolio

## My background:
I am a recent [Physics](https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/education) graduate from [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu/). If I were to come up with a name for the focus of courses that I have taken, I would say Condensed Matter and Optics Applications. In my opinion, my two quarters of Condensed Matter, one quarter of Optics and one quarter of Quantum Photonics Experiment shaped my perspective as a physics student driven by physical applications.

## Research:
I have one year of research experience in UV photonics in the [Materials Department](https://ssleec.ucsb.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Shuji Nakamura](https://materials.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/shuji-nakamura).

Try and find me! Can't tell you my name though sorry haha.

I have also previously conducted research at [San Francisco State University](https://engineering.sfsu.edu/) for a mitigation lab to help develop a MATLAB program for [Dr. Zhaoshuo Jiang](https://engineering.sfsu.edu/faculty-profile-zhaoshuo-jiang) in 2019.

## Outside of school:
I have previously been a lifeguard and swim instructor both at [SF Rec&Park](https://sfrecpark.org/482/Swimming-Pools) and [UCSF RecCen](https://campuslifeserviceshome.ucsf.edu/fitnessrecreation/aquatics), as well as a peer instructor for instructional aid at [Skyline College](https://www.skylinecollege.edu/stemcenter/index.php). At the moment I am a gymnastics coach at [Santa Barbara Gymnastics (Gym) Club](https://www.santabarbaragymnasticsclub.com/) teaching summer/winter camps and tumbling/gymnastics/parkour classes. Other times I am just enjoying the settings and sceneries of Santa Barbara and hanging out with friends.
