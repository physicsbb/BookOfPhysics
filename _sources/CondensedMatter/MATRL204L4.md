# (MATRL204L4) Review of Spin (supplemented with Griffiths QM)
Books used for this section:
* Intro to Quantum Mechanics by Griffiths 3rd Ed. 

Recall that from our last lecture, we have derived the vector potential used for the magnetic field, a coordinate free expression of the magnetic field. The vivid physical reality of electrons in a Magnetic Field can be explained on a few different levels. 
* Electron in a Magnetic Field
    1. magnetic dipole moment $\vec{m}$ or some books might use $\vec{\mu}$
    2. Separate components to the spin, 
        1. Electron **Spin** Dipole moment 
        2. Electron **Orbital** Dipole moment
    3. Zeeman Effect, which uses perturbation to account for the dipole moment under a uniform external magnetic field $\vec{B}$. 

## Hamiltonian of the Spin
Save it for later. Don't have time to focus on this

## Clebsch Gordan Coefficients for wavefunctions
Save it for later. Don't have time to document this yet.
