# Random ideas?

## Potentially a bunch of bad ideas that are just a waste of time?
* Self study semiconductor device physics? (probably the most important and really worthwhile as a device and epitaxy engineer)
* An interactive map that plots the uprising of religions/civilizations/etc with respect to time? 
* My attempt at solving any Qualifying Exams' problems (as a prep work for grad school and passing the free-response questions, haha)?
* Self-study in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning? Pursuit of a computational black box?
* Convergence in the method of steepest descent from Complex Analysis? 
* BS flavored politics? haha

Hey! Time enjoyed getting wasted is not wasting time, right?

## Scratching my head again... 
What are the four types of invariance in physics again? 
1. Translational
2. Rotational
3. Time-reversal 

WHich one is the 4th one again?
